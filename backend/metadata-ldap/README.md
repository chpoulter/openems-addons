# openems-backend-metadata-ldap
OpenEMS Backend implementation for LDAP Metadata.

Allows authentication, authorization and edge configuration through a LDAP server.

[https://github.com/chpoulter/openems-addons](https://github.com/chpoulter/openems-addons "https://github.com/chpoulter/openems-addons")

## Build

Just build with maven clean package and you'll get a jar file that can be added to the felix load folder.

You will need a local maven repository containing OpenEMS bundles. Use maven-repo to generate one.

## LDAP example structure

*Note:* In my LDAP the memberOf overlay is installed. It creates and updates the memberOf attribute automatically. If you do not have this overlay (which is the default), you need to maintain this attribute on your own, meaning you have to add and maintain it by hand.

I have been running my LDAP for ages, but afaik memberOf overlay is deprecated for some time now. Unfortunately I did not have time to think of alternatives yet ... dynlist overlay might be a good try.
