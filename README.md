# openems-maven-repo

As OpenEMS does not deploy its artifacts to a public repository, you need a local repository for developing extensions externally. This project will generate a folder **openems-maven-repo** including class and source files of some chosen bundles.

## Build

A build script **build.sh** is included, just run it. You will need docker installed for it.
